# Attendance-System
This web-based application is mainly developed for Attendance Monitoring and Leave management of the any department in college.
It will help the Teacher to fill up the attendance of particular subject and lab batch, teacher also add leave application.
HOD/Coordinator can view pending leave application and approve it or declined. HOD/Coordinator can also view report and 
graph of particular division, lab batch, student, subject attendance.
Admin have the functionality like backup, restore, add and manage teacher, student and other things.

In these project I use Java RESTFul Web service, Hibernate for Backend. For Frontend I Use HTML, 
CSS, Bootstrap and for calling web service I use JQuery, also for handling return data from 
Web service I use Javascript. for generating graph report I use ChartJS.
